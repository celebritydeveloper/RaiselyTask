              <p class="question"> <span>&#9734;</span> Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Success Specialist role?</p>

              <div class="answer">Interacting with people is fun for me because I get to listen to their needs, concerns, and interests.
            I love solving problems, it is a hobby for me to take up challenges because they only make me better at the end of the
            day also I get this reassurance and fulfillment that I was part of solving someone's problem thereby making the world
            even a more better place.

            <p class="question"> <span>&#9734;</span> Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?</p>
        
            <div class="answer">Raisely is a fundraising platform that helps organizations raise funds for their project.
            Personally, I love helping people make life easier for them and Raisely is doing a lot in this aspect.
            With Raisely, I will get to help people achieve success by helping them with their instant and long term needs.
            I want to be part of a family and culture that use technology to lend a helping hand. Raisely is that place for me.
            Personally, I wouldn't mind working with Raisely without getting paid, money isn't an issue right now for me although I
            have to pay bills.
            I just want to be part of an awesome team that is solving problems.</div>
